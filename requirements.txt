# Desktop Automation Tool Dependencies

# Core Python libraries (usually included with Python)
tkinter>=8.6  # GUI framework (note: usually built-in with Python)
os  # Operating system interface (built-in)
sys  # System-specific parameters and functions (built-in)
subprocess  # Subprocess management (built-in)
threading  # Thread-based parallelism (built-in)
logging  # Logging facility (built-in)
datetime  # Date and time handling (built-in)
shutil  # High-level file operations (built-in)
glob  # Unix style pathname pattern expansion (built-in)
re  # Regular expression operations (built-in)

# Archive handling libraries
tarfile  # Read and write tar archive files (built-in)
zipfile  # Work with ZIP archives (built-in)

# Additional dependencies (if needed)
# Note: Most functionality uses built-in Python libraries
# External dependencies are minimal to ensure compatibility

# Development and testing dependencies
# pytest>=6.0.0  # Testing framework (uncomment if needed)
# black>=21.0.0  # Code formatter (uncomment if needed)
# flake8>=3.8.0  # Code linter (uncomment if needed)

# External tools required (not Python packages):
# - 7-Zip: Required for .7z and .rar file extraction
#   Download from: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
#   Ensure 7z.exe is in system PATH or default installation directory

# Platform-specific notes:
# - Windows: All dependencies should work out of the box with Python 3.7+
# - The tool is specifically designed for Windows environments
# - tkinter is included with most Python installations on Windows

# Installation notes:
# Most dependencies are built-in Python modules
# Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
# However, most imports should work without additional installations
